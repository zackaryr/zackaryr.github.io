      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching, whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.</p>

      <p>So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and get out into the great outdoors!</p>
